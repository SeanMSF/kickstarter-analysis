Overview of Project: Kickstarter data was analyzed to look for evidence of what makes a successful kickstarter campaign

Purpose: To analyze Kickstarter data from around the world in order to inform the strategy for creating a new play or musical

### Analysis and Challenges- Please see Excel for analysis of Kickstarter data

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 

Launch dates in summer months tended to be more succesful.
Whether a performance was Failed or canceled had little to do with launch date.
Success and Failure rates were roughly equal in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: 

Failed US Kickstarter campaigns have higher goals for funding than successful US Kickstarters, approximately twice as high.
The pledged value for failed campaigns was also much lower, about 1/10th on average than a successful campaign.
Goals of less than 1000 to 5000 are most likely to succeed (>75%). 66% likelihood of success in the 35-45k range. Goals greater than 50k were unlikely to succeed (12.5%).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:

Familiarizing myself with the tools took some time. Sorting data could not take place with a pivot table open, so I had to be comfortable closing a pivot table in order to move forward with the analysis. The expectations of a README were unclear until practice could take place in later modules.

### Results:

Two conclusions one can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date include that Kickstarter campaigns tend to be short, running only about 1 month in length.
Year round, more Kickstarter campaigns succeed than fail, but in December, success and failure occurs nearly equally. 
The highest percentage of successful campaigns take place in May, June and July.

We can conclude a lot about Outcomes based on goals. Failed US Kickstarter campaigns have higher goals for funding than successful US Kickstarters, approximately twice as high, on average for Failed campaigns. 
As one might expect, the pledged value for failed campaigns was also much lower, about 1/10th on average than a successful campaign!

### Limitations:
Some limitations of this dataset include that he data doesn't really tell us anything about other aspects of the businesses in question's strategy, including marketing or advertising, which would be vital in a normal business decision making environment. So this info remains limited. It doesn't tell us anything about broader strategy, either that the firms utilized bwith respect to implementing kickstarter. An interesting table to create would be one that looks at the most successful field utilizing kickstarter. Success could be defined as amount funded above goal. These cases could then be surveyed or otherwise studied further to determine what they are doing right. Cases with high numbers of backers could be highlighted in order to glean details on how they recruited so many initial investors. 
The highest average donations may be worth analyzing. Conversely, one could look at the opposite, failed kickstarters, and come up with a list of pitfalls to avoid. Kickstarters who reached zero of their goal would be best to inspect for bad behavior, whereas others who may have goals too lofty could be studied to determine how they reached their numbers and what assumptions are being made. Obviously these suggestions go beyond the scope of the module.
