Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project
Kickstarter data was analyzed to look for evidence of what makes a successful kickstarter campaign

Purpose
To analyze Kickstarter data from around the world in order to inform the strategy for creating a new play or musical

Analysis and Challenges
Please see Excel for analysis of Kickstarter data

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
Please see Excel Doc

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Familiarizing myself with the tools took some time. Sorting data could not take place with a pivot table open, so I had to be comfortable closing a pivot table in order to move forward with the analysis.

Results

Two conclusions one can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date include that Kickstarter campaigns tend to be short, running only about 1 month in length.
Year round, more Kickstarter campaigns succeed than fail, but in December, success and failure occurs nearly equally. 
The highest percentage of successful campaigns take place in May, June and July.

We can conclude a lot about Outcomes based on goals. Failed US Kickstarter campaigns have higher goals for funding than successful US Kickstarters, approximately twice as high, on average for Failed campaigns. 
As one might expect, the pledged value for failed campaigns was also much lower, about 1/10th on average than a successful campaign!


Some limitations of this dataset include that he data doesn't really tell us anything about marketing, including advertising. It also doesn't tell us anything about broader strategy, either that the firm utilized broadly nor with respect to implementing kickstarter.

Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create: An interesting table to create would be one that looks at the most successful field utilizing kickstarter. Success could be defined as amount funded above goal. These cases could then be surveyed or otherwise studied further to determine what they are doing right. Cases with high numbers of backers could be highlighted in order to glean details on how they recruited so many initial investors. 
The highest average donations may be worth analyzing. For groups with high averages and low standard deviations, coupled with a large number of donors, it is likely that a robust marketing strategy is taking place that should be replicated. Wealthy donors/funders on one project may also be interested in funding others and should be cultivated. 
Conversely, one could look at the opposite, failed kickstarters, and come up with a list of pitfalls to avoid. Kickstarters who reached zero of their goal would be best to inspect for bad behavior, whereas others who may have goals too lofty could be studied to determine how they reached their numbers and what assumptions are being made.
